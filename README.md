# Codepen Clone

App where you can write your code in your browser like you do in Codepen. This is just a small application where you can write your HTML, CSS and JS code and preview the result. Currently, this editor didn't support to install any dependency. So, if you want to use any dependency include it's CDN in HTML script tag. 

Example to use axios library:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/0.27.2/axios.min.js" integrity="sha512-odNmoc1XJy5x1TMVMdC7EMs3IVdItLPlCeL5vSUPN2llYKMJ2eByTTAIiiuqLg+GdNr9hF6z81p27DArRFKT7A==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
```


## How to run
- Clone repository and run `npm install`
- As node_module install, run npm start.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
